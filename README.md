## What problems are we solving?

MSMEs in Sub-saharan Africa (particularly Nigeria) are heavily dependent on soft loans from the BOI, Commercial Banks or other Soft loans organizations. Due to high nterest rates & heavy debt , MSMEs can't maintain a steady business processes.


## Our solution to the problem:

**SmartFinance**,  is a blockchain based transparent market place where the SMSEs and consumers could implement a co-operative business method. Here, the SMSEs can list the potential products and the expected profits on his business on the distributed public ledger.

Smart contracts can provide a better agreement between the MSMEs and consumers in case of discrepancies.
